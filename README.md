# Secure Systems Lab Guidelines

Welcome to the [Secure Systems Lab (SSL)](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/)
Guidelines repo! Below you can find relevant guides and how-tos
for working and collaborating in the lab.

* On-boarding -- You are new to SSL and its operations?
  The [on-boarding guide](on-boarding.md) helps you get up to speed.
* Starting a new project -- Follow our [new projects guide](newproject.md)
  to start your project on the right foot.
* Reporting progress -- Document your achievements and share your insights
  by following the [progress report guide](progressreport.md).
* Software development platform -- New to Git and GitHub?  Have a look at
  the [introductory guide for Git and GitHub](git-github-introduction.md),
  which is our lab's recommended software development platform.
* Software development workflow -- Use the workflow outlined in our general
  [development guidelines](dev-workflow.md).
* Code style guidelines -- Please follow the
  [lab's coding guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines).
* Writing LaTeX documents -- Clear communication is key at SSL, and
  our [LaTeX guide](latexdocuments.md) helps you master an academic
  researcher's number 1 document preparation system.
* Sample documents -- There exist documents that are common to projects.
  For example, a document that instructs users on how to submit vulnerability
  reports, or a configuration file for a static code analysis tool.  We recommend
  that new projects browse the
  [sample documents](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/sample-documents)
  repo for integrable files.
